### Context Budget Allocation

| Lookup Type | Primary Docs | WikiLink Budget | Total Lines |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Quick       | 600 lines    | 300 lines       | 900 lines   |
| Standard    | 1200 lines   | 750 lines       | 1950 lines  |
| Deep        | 4000 lines   | 3300 lines      | 7300 lines  |

### Link Prioritization Algorithm

- **+10 points**: Exact keyword match in WikiLink name
- **+5 points**: Pattern/Principle documents
- **+4 points**: Best practice documents
- **+3 points**: Component documents (Plugin, Provider, Builder, Extractor)

Links followed in priority order to maximize relevance within context budget.

### Cycle Prevention

- Visited documents tracked using temp file (`/tmp/wikilink_visited.*`)
- Each document visited only once per traversal
- DFS stops at max depth or max document limits
- Graceful handling of broken links (logged but don't fail)

### Benefits

- **Complete Information**: DFS ensures no connected knowledge is missed
- **Automatic Discovery**: Finds prerequisites, related patterns, and implementations via natural document links
- **Context-Aware**: Prioritizes relevant links based on query keywords
- **Efficient Navigation**: Follows the knowledge bank's natural Obsidian WikiLink structure
- **Depth Tracking**: Know which concepts are prerequisites (depth 1) vs implementation details (depth 2-3)

### Files Added
- `scripts/wikilink-utils.sh` (331 lines) - Core WikiLink utilities
- `scripts/test-wikilinks.sh` (249 lines) - Comprehensive test suite

- **Integrated with common utilities**: All 7 shell scripts now use `~/.claude/skills/common/get_kb_path.sh`
- **No default fallback**: System errors out if KB_PATH not configured (forces proper setup)
- **Updated all documentation**: SKILL.md, references, and examples use `{KB_PATH}` placeholder

### Added
- Configuration section in SKILL.md explaining path resolution priority
- Clear error messages when KB path not configured
- Verification command: `~/.claude/skills/common/setup_kb_path.sh`

### Files Updated
- **7 shell scripts** in `scripts/`: Now source common utilities
- **SKILL.md**: Added Configuration section, updated Base Path reference
- **references/templates.md**: All paths use `{KB_PATH}` placeholder
- **references/examples.md**: Examples show dynamic path usage
- **references/knowledge-bank-structure.md**: Removed hardcoded path
- **references/session-documentation.md**: Command uses `{KB_PATH}` placeholder
- **~/.claude/skills/common/get_kb_path.sh**: Removed default fallback

### Path Resolution Priority
1. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (PRIMARY - recommended)
2. `CLAUDE_KB_PATH` environment variable (temporary override)
3. `~/.claude/config/kb.conf` (alternative)
4. **ERROR** if none found (no default fallback)

### Benefits
- **Fully portable**: Works on any machine with proper configuration
- **Zero tolerance**: Forces users to configure path properly
- **Single source of truth**: Path configured in one place
- **Clear errors**: Helpful messages guide users to fix configuration
- **Consistent with session-recap**: Both skills use same utilities

### Migration for Existing Users
Your existing setup should work automatically if `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is properly configured with the Knowledge Bank Integration section.

To verify: `~/.claude/skills/common/setup_kb_path.sh`

- Contains 5 reflection questions: what worked, what didn't, what failed, improvements, what would make it seamless
- Lighter than technical docs: 5-8 cross-references vs 10-15 for technical documentation
- Separate from technical docs: Reflections = HOW you work, Technical docs = WHAT you build

### Validation Results
- ✅ Structure verification: PASSED
- ✅ Document count drift: 0% (perfect accuracy)
- ✅ All workflows updated consistently
- ✅ JSON schema includes reflection_insights in all lookup types
- ✅ All templates include reflection check as step 0
